# TreeChain: Bridging Nature and Technology

Explore the application: [https://treechain.xyz](https://treechain.xyz)

TreeChain is an innovative project that encourages people to connect with nature. Our platform allows users to explore and document various species of plants and vegetation in the Northeast region. By scanning and verifying these species, users earn unique AI-generated NFTs that are added to their collection.

### The TreeChain Difference
TreeChain offers a captivating way to gather vital data on plant species in the Northeast. Our scannable feature, coupled with AI classification, enables the collection of crucial metrics, including those related to endangered or invasive species. By doing so, we empower communities to address problematic vegetation and safeguard endangered plants.

### AI-Powered Data Collection
Our solution leverages the power of artificial intelligence for data collection. In return for their contributions, users are rewarded with valuable NFTs.

### Building on Past Successes
While similar to the Cornell eBird application, TreeChain distinguishes itself by encompassing a wider range of plant species. Unlike eBird, we provide mechanisms to verify the accuracy of species documentation.

### Funding and Expansion
We are seeking $5000 in initial funding to support the growth of TreeChain. Our plan includes launching the application in educational institutions, particularly universities and schools, where the study of species and biology is prevalent.

### Technology Stack
- Connex: We use Connex for seamless application integration.
- Stable Diffusion: Our NFTs are generated using stable diffusion.
- Webcam Integration: We employ react-webcam for webcam functionality.
- Machine Learning: PyTorch and ezkl power our CNN models.
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs: ezkl is also used to create zero-knowledge proofs.
- Deployment: The application is hosted on AWS EC2 instances and Heroku.

TreeChain brings together nature enthusiasts, technology enthusiasts, and conservationists to make a positive impact on our environment. Join us in this exciting journey toward a greener, more connected future.

## TreeChain: VeChain + BCG + EasyA Hackathon at Harvard

See the application at [treechain.xyz](treechain.xyz)

TreeChain is a project that involves people to get connected with nature. Users can explore and capture different species of plants and vegetation. After scanning and verifying the species, a special AI generated NFT is added to their collection.

TreeChain is a fun way to capture metrics around species of plants in the Northeast region. The scannable feature and AI classification allows the collection of metrics for endangered or envasive species. Helping communities combat problematic vegetation and save at risk plants.

TreeChain is an AI powered solution to data collection for vegetation.
